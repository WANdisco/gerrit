  - Invalid Gerrit events are now placed in a failed directory.
  - Support replicated events for "adv_bases".
  
fixes:
  - Fix non-POSIX coding in "gerrit.sh" so will work on all Linux distros WANdisco supports.
  - Eliminate “ulimit -n” command from “gerrit.sh” startup script that caused unnecessary failure in replicated environment.
