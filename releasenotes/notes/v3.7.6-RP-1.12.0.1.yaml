features:
- "New property gerrit.replicated.cache.names.to.ignore has been added to allow control of default ignored caches. See [Replicated cache names to ignore](https://docs.cirata.com/gerrit/3.7.0/index.html#_replicated_cache_names_to_ignore)."
fixes:
- "GerritMS 3.7.0 is based on Gerrit 3.7.6+ there are additional fixes included. One of those was to fix [CVE-2023-48795](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48795)"
issues:
- "Gerrit 'experimental features' are not supported in GerritMS 3.7.0."
- "Plugin 'web-hooks' must only be deployed on a single node (or duplication of notifications will result)."
other:
- "The 3.7 release of Gerrit requires that 'jgit' configuration items be moved into the ${site}/etc/jgit.config file. If you were running earlier version(s) of Gerrit you may have 'jgit' configurations in 'gerrit.config' or in the OS account that Gerrit runs as in the ~/.gitconfig configuration files. Gerrit default is for receive.autogc = false in order to prevent possible overwhelming of Java Object Heap Garbage Collection."
- "Gerrit has introduced a new feature which allows deadlines to be set on requests at either a server or client level. See [Gerrit user-request-cancellation-and-deadlines](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-request-cancellation-and-deadlines.html) It is strongly recommended to not use this feature. Such deadlines are necessarily longer in a fully primary/primary setup, especially when large latencies exist between servers. Use of this feature could cause non-atomic operations resulting in a half-finished state requiring manual administrative cleanup."
