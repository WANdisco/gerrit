      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
          that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.

               (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.

5. Application of this License.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

THESE TERMS AND CUSTOMER WILL NOT HAVE ANY LICENSE TO ANY PART OF THE SOFTWARE OR RIGHT TO USE
ANY PART OF THE SOFTWARE.  WANDISCO'S ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON CUSTOMER'S
ASSENT TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS; IF

WANdisco (as defined below) offers a suite of software and maintenance and support services to its customers.  In addition,
WANdisco performs Professional Services (as defined below).  In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and conditions herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.    DEFINITIONS.
    1.1.    "Affiliates" means in relation to either party, each and any subsidiary or holding company of that party and each and any
    subsidiary of a holding company of that party.

    1.2.    "Confidential Information" means:  (a) the Software; and (b) any business or technical information of WANdisco or
    Customer, including but not limited to any information relating to WANdisco's or Customer's product plans, designs, costs,
    product prices and names, finances, marketing plans, business opportunities, personnel, research, development or know-how
    that is designated by the disclosing party as "confidential" or "proprietary" and, if orally disclosed, reduced to writing by the
    disclosing party within thirty (30) days of such disclosure.

    1.3.    "Intellectual Property Rights" means patent rights (including patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trademark
    rights, trade secret rights, know-how and any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the
    world.

    1.4.    "Professional Services" means additional services over and above maintenance and support such as installation,
    training, implementation and customization and provided on a project by project basis.

    1.5.    "Quotation" or "Quote" means the quote generated by WANdisco in response to Customer's indication of interest in the
    Software and associated maintenance and support services and/or Professional Services.  Quotes may also include the
    checkout page of an e-commerce website on which the Software is acquired.  The Quotation will contain particulars with
    respect to the Software, service, term, price and other details.  All Quotations are subject to and governed by the terms and
    conditions of this Agreement unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by the parties.

    1.6.    "Software" means WANdisco's proprietary software products in object code form only, and related documentation,
    identified in the applicable Quotation and licensed for use by Customer pursuant to this Agreement, including any error
    corrections and updates thereto provided by WANdisco to Customer under this Agreement.  Software does not include OSS
    (as defined below).

    1.7.    "WANdisco" means the WANdisco entity named in the applicable Quotation.

2.    LICENSE.
    2.1.    Subscription Licenses.  For Quotes in which Customer has ordered a subscription license, and subject to the terms
    and conditions of this Agreement and in consideration of the fees paid by Customer hereunder, WANdisco grants to Customer
    a nonexclusive, nontransferable license, during the applicable term, to use the Software solely in accordance with the
    applicable documentation and solely for Customer's internal business use, except as otherwise may be expressly permitted in
    this Agreement. WANdisco reserves all rights and licenses in and to the Software not expressly granted herein.

    2.2.    Perpetual.  For Quotes in which Customer has ordered a perpetual license, and subject to the terms and conditions of
    this Agreement and in consideration of the fees paid by Customer hereunder, WANdisco grants to Customer a non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, perpetual (except as set forth in Section 11) license to use the Software solely in accordance with the
    applicable documentation and solely for Customer's internal business use, except as otherwise may be expressly permitted in
    this Agreement. WANdisco reserves all rights and licenses in and to the Software not expressly granted herein.

    2.3.    Usage Limitations.  Customer's use of the Software may be subject to usage limitations and other restrictions as
    described in the applicable Quotation (e.g., number of Fusion zones, data nodes, volume of replicated data, number of data
    storage types, number of users etc.)  Exceeding such usage limitations or restrictions may result in additional charges for
    which WANdisco will invoice Customer in accordance with Section 6 of this Agreement.  Failure to pay such additional charges
    may result in termination of Customer's license.  For purposes of this Agreement, (a) a "Fusion zone" is an instance of a
    logical storage system for which Fusion provides replication functionality. Such systems are responsible for storing the data
    that are replicated. Each Fusion Zone is serviced by one or more Fusion servers, and can participate in replication with other
    Fusion Zones. For example, a Fusion Zone could be a Hadoop cluster, an object storage bucket or endpoint, and or a locally-
    mounted file system; (b) "data nodes" means servers on which the Software is installed and on which data is made available
    for replication; (c) "replicated data" means the amount of data Customer makes available for replication by the Software, the
    amount of data Customer actually replicates, or the amount of data which has been checked for consistency, whichever is
    larger, regardless of the number of replicated copies, all consistent with WANdisco's Fair Use Policy.  "Fair Use Policy" means
    that once data has been replicated it is assumed such data maintains value for the remainder of the license term and hence
    continues to count against any data under replication quota.  For example, if Customer purchases a 3PB license with a one
    year term, and on day one of such term replicates 1PB then 2PB of quota remains accessible to Customer under the license.
    Customer may not take any action, or use any hardware, software or other method, designed to circumvent, or which has the
    effect of circumventing, any usage limitations?

    2.4.    Trial License.  Customer may be issued or provided access to a trial version of the Software.  Such trial version will be
    time limited and will provide Customer the opportunity to evaluate the Software prior to purchasing a license.  Upon conclusion
    of the applicable trial period, Customer shall either purchase a subscription or perpetual license, in which case a new license
    key will be issued, or Customer must immediately remove and cease using the Software.  DATA USED DURING A TRIAL OR
    DEMONSTRATION OF THE SOFTWARE MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO DATA CENTERS LOCATED IN THE UNITED
    STATES OR ELSEWHERE OUTSIDE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.  CUSTOMER WILL NOT TRANSFER ANY
    PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR OTHER INFORMATION OR DATA THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE GDPR
    OR ANY OTHER LAW OR REGULATION.  CUSTOMER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL DATA USED DURING ANY
    SUCH TRIAL OR DEMONSTRATION AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW.

    2.5.    Quick Start or Restricted License.  Customer may purchase a "quick start" or other form of reduced usage or restricted
    license to the Software.  The applicable Quotation will describe the permitted usage and any other limitations for Customer's
    use of the Software.  Exceeding such usage or other restrictions may result in a requirement that Customer purchase the
    applicable non-restricted or "enterprise" license and terminate the restricted license, all of which will be described in a new
    Quotation.

    2.6.    License Keys.  Software usage is enabled via license keys provided by WANdisco upon payment of applicable license
    fees.  License keys are associated with applicable usage restrictions as described in Section 2.3, and once a license key has
    been issued, the applicable usage cannot be decreased during the applicable term of the key.  Increases to usage via
    separate Quotations will result in a new license key being issued.  If the Software is deployed in multiple replication groups or
    clusters, etc. a separate license key will be issued for each such replication group or clusters, following which usage in one
    replication group or cluster cannot be transferred to another replication group or cluster during the applicable term of the
    license key.  WANdisco may use license keys to enforce time and usage limitations of the Software and Customer shall take
    no action designed to alter or circumvent such enforcement.

    2.7.    License Restrictions.  Customer has no right to transfer, sublicense or otherwise distribute the Software to any third
    party.  Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement and by applicable law, the license granted above does not permit
    Customer to, and Customer may not permit third parties to:  (a) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the object
    code of the Software; (b) copy the Software, except for a reasonable number of backup copies; or (c) use the Software in any
    manner to provide service bureau, time-sharing or other computer services to third parties.  Use of the Software by or for the
    benefit of an Affiliate of Customer is not permitted unless specifically authorized in writing by WANdisco.

    2.8.    Maintenance and Support Services.  Subject to payment of the applicable fees, WANdisco will perform the
    maintenance and support services specified in a Quotation in accordance with WANdisco's standard Software maintenance
    and support procedures as described in Appendix A, incorporated into this Agreement by reference, which WANdisco
    publishes from time to time.

    2.9.    End of Life Policy.  WANdisco reserves the right to "end-of-life" certain software applications including the Software.  In
    such event, an end of life ("EOL") notice will be provided at least six (6) months prior to the date on which the Software will
    become obsolete.  During the EOL notice period, WANdisco will work with Customer to determine an appropriate migration
    path.  Customer shall be entitled to continue using EOL Software following the end of the EOL notice period but WANdisco will
    no longer provide any maintenance and support services for such EOL Software.

3.    PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
    3.1.    Services Provided.  Details concerning Professional Services to be performed by WANdisco (or by its Affiliates or its or
    their authorized subcontractors and certified channel partners) will be described in separate statements of work ("SOW")
    describing the project and related terms, if any, specific to the applicable Customer project.  All requests for Professional
    Services shall be accompanied by a completed SOW, a copy of which shall be attached to this Agreement at the appropriate
    time and deemed incorporated by reference herein.  No SOW shall be effective unless and until accepted in writing by
    WANdisco.  Any changes, amendments, or waivers ("Changes") to any SOW, or the Professional Services provided
    thereunder, requested by either party must be mutually agreed upon in writing and signed (each a "Change Order").
    WANdisco shall not be required to provide any Change unless and until a Change Order has been signed by an authorized
    representative of both parties, and any delay or additional charges resulting from any delay of Customer to execute a Change
    Order shall be the sole responsibility of Customer.  Changes to SOWs may result in adjustments to the charges and delays or
    changes in scheduled Professional Services.  Unless specifically agreed in an applicable SOW, Professional Services will be
    performed only during WANdisco's normal business hours, excluding weekends and holidays.  Requests by Customer to have
    Professional Services provided outside of normal business hours are Changes and must first be agreed to by WANdisco in a
    Change Order.

    3.2.    Term and Termination of Statements of Work.  Each SOW shall commence upon its execution by both parties and
    shall continue until all tasks described therein are completed, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Section 3.2.  A SOW
    may be terminated by either party if any material breach of such SOW continues uncorrected for more than 30 days (10 days
    in the event of non-payment) after receipt of written notice from the aggrieved party describing the breach.  In the event of
    termination or expiration of this Agreement, all outstanding SOWs shall immediately terminate, unless otherwise agreed in
    writing by the parties.

    3.3.    Work Product.  Unless otherwise specifically agreed in an applicable SOW, WANdisco shall own all right, title and
    interest (including all Intellectual Property Rights) in and to all inventions (whether or not patentable), works of authorship,
    designs, know-how, ideas and information made or conceived or reduced to practice, in whole or in part, by or on behalf of
    WANdisco in connection with the Professional Services ("Work Product").  All Work Product created hereunder shall be
    licensed to Customer upon the same terms and conditions, and subject to the same restrictions, as the Software is licensed to
    Customer hereunder.

4.    CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS.
    4.1.    Certification.  At WANdisco's written request and not more frequently than annually, Customer shall furnish WANdisco
    with a signed certification verifying that the Software is being used in compliance with the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement, including without limitation any applicable usage limitations.  WANdisco shall have the right to periodically audit
    Customer's usage of the Software, either physically or via remote access, and Customer shall provide reasonable assistance
    during any such audit.

    4.2.    Cooperation and Data.  Customer acknowledges that in order to properly perform its obligations under this Agreement
    and any executed statements of work, WANdisco may require access to Customer's premises, property, equipment, network,
    and other information, data and/or documentation ("Data") that WANdisco reasonably requests from Customer.  If Customer
    fails in the timely provision of Data, or fails to provide other access or cooperation, and such failures require additions,
    corrections or modifications related to WANdisco's performance, Customer will reimburse WANdisco for resulting costs.

    4.3.    Virus Prevention and Security.  WANdisco does not protect against, nor accept any liability for, third party intrusion into
    or damage to Customer's network or data center.  Customer must take all necessary steps to prevent against viruses,
    malicious code, hacking and other forms of network intrusion consistent with industry standards.  Customer represents and
    warrants that it understands and complies with all applicable laws and regulations related to or governing collection, storage,
    use and transmission of data.

5.    OWNERSHIP.  WANdisco or its Affiliates and their licensors presently own and will continue to own all worldwide right,
    title, and interest in and to the Software, including without limitation all modifications, revisions and derivative works thereto, by
    whomever made, and all worldwide Intellectual Property Rights therein.  Customer will not delete nor in any manner alter the
    copyright, trademark, and other proprietary rights notices of WANdisco or its Affiliates and their licensors appearing on the
    Software as delivered to Customer.  Customer will reproduce such notices on all copies it makes of the Software.

6.    PAYMENT.
    6.1.    Perpetual and Fixed Terms Licenses.
        (a)    License Fees.  Customer will pay to WANdisco the license fees set forth in the Quotation in accordance with the payment
        schedule set forth therein.  If the Quotation does not include a payment schedule, then payment of license fees are due in total
        in advance of commencement of the license.  If Customer requires a purchase order prior to payment of WANdisco's invoice, it
        shall be Customer's responsibility to generate and issue any such purchase order in enough time to prevent delay and/or
        termination of this Agreement and the applicable licenses.
        (b)    Maintenance and Support Fees.  Customer will pay to WANdisco the maintenance and support fees set forth in the
        Quotation in accordance with the payment schedule set forth therein.  If the Quotation does not include a payment schedule,
        then payment of maintenance and support fees are due annually in advance.  WANdisco shall have the right to revise the
        maintenance and support fees.  In such event, WANdisco shall notify Customer if, and by what amount, it intends to change
        the Maintenance and Support Fees, and Customer shall have the right, following such notice, to either continue to receive
        maintenance and support services under this Agreement and pay the revised fees or notify WANdisco, in writing no later than
        thirty (30) days following the date of WANdisco's notice, of Customer's intention to terminate its maintenance and support
        services at the end of the current period.  No change in maintenance and support fees shall affect Customer's current
        maintenance and support services for which Customer has already paid.
        (c)    OSS Support Services Fees. Customer will pay to WANdisco the OSS support fees set forth in the Quotation in
        accordance with the payment schedule set forth therein.  If the Quotation does not include a payment schedule, then payment

    6.2.    Subscription Licenses.
        (a)    Subscription Fees.  Customer will pay to WANdisco the subscription fees set forth in the Quotation in accordance with
        the payment schedule set forth therein.  If the Quotation does not include a payment schedule, then payment of subscription
        fees is due annually, in advance without invoice, with payment of the first year's subscription fees due immediately following
        WANdisco's provision of the applicable license key to Customer.  If Customer requires a purchase order prior to payment of
        WANdisco's invoice, it shall be Customer's responsibility to generate and issue any such purchase order in enough time to
        prevent termination of this Agreement and the applicable licenses.  WANdisco shall have the right to revise the subscription
        fees at the end of Customer's applicable term.  In such event, WANdisco shall notify Customer if, and by what amount, it
        intends to change the subscription fees, and Customer shall have the right, following such notice, to either continue its
        Subscription under this Agreement and pay the revised subscription fees or notify WANdisco, in writing no later than thirty (30)
        days following the date of WANdisco's notice, of Customer's intention to terminate its subscription at the end of the current
        period.  No change in subscription fees shall affect Customer's current subscription for which Customer has already paid
        subscription fees.
        (b)    Maintenance and Support Fees. Maintenance and support services fees indicated on the applicable Quotation will be
        billed on an annual basis, payable in advance, unless otherwise stated in the applicable Quotation. In the event Customer fails
        to pay WANdisco on the due date, then to reinstate or renew maintenance and support services (if allowed by WANdisco),
        Customer must first pay WANdisco (i) the annual maintenance and support services fee, and (ii) the applicable reinstatement
        charge.
        (c)    OSS Support Services Fees. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Quotation, OSS support services fees are
        included in the subscription fees paid by Customer.

    6.3.    Multi-Year Licenses.  Customer acknowledges that multi-year licenses have been negotiated on the basis of
    preferential pricing for a multiple year commitment.  If a multi-year license is terminated early for any reason other than
    WANdisco's uncured breach, all unpaid license fees for the remaining years of the license term shall immediately become due
    and payable.

    6.4.    Professional Services.  Unless otherwise specified in an applicable statement of work, Professional Services shall be
    provided on a time and materials basis at the rates specified in the applicable SOW.  Customer will pay to WANdisco all
    amounts owed under an SOW no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice.

    6.5.    Travel and Incidental Expenses.  Customer will reimburse WANdisco for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
    incurred by WANdisco in connection with performing services at locations other than WANdisco's facility and, if Professional
    Services are provided under an SOW such expenses shall be reimbursed in accordance with the SOW.  Payment shall be
    made no later than thirty (30) days from the date of WANdisco's applicable invoice.

    6.6.    Payment Terms and Taxes.  Customer will pay all amounts due under this Agreement in the currency stated in the
    applicable Quotation and no later than thirty (30) days from the date of WANdisco's applicable invoice therefor.  All past due
    amounts will incur interest at a rate equal to the lower of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by law, beginning as of
    ten (10) days after the applicable due date.  Customer will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all applicable taxes of any
    kind (including but not limited to sales and use taxes) associated with this Agreement or Customer's receipt or use of the
    Software or the performance of services hereunder, except for example, taxes based on WANdisco's net income.  Termination
    or expiration of this Agreement, or any statement of work, shall not relieve Customer of any payment obligation incurred prior
    to such termination or expiration.

7.    WARRANTY.
    7.1.    Limited Software Warranty.  WANdisco warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days after the date the applicable
    license keys are provided the Software will function substantially in accordance with WANdisco's published documentation.
    Customer must notify WANdisco of any breach of the foregoing warranty no later than thirty (30) days following completion of
    the 90-day warranty period.  As Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and WANdisco's entire liability for any breach of the
    foregoing warranty, WANdisco will, at its sole option and expense, promptly repair or replace any Software that fails to meet
    this limited warranty.

    7.2.    Services Warranty.  WANdisco warrants that services provided by WANdisco hereunder will be performed in a good

    applicable service, WANdisco will correct at WANdisco's expense, any non-conforming portion of such service.

    7.3.    Third Party Products.  The Software is designed to work with third party storage solutions.  WANdisco makes no
    warranty, express or implied, with respect to such third party products and is not responsible for failure of the overall solution
    to operate properly if such failures are a result of third party products.  WANdisco may be required to interact with such third
    parties in order to diagnose and resolve problems, and Customer agrees to coordinate communication and cooperation
    between WANdisco and such third parties.

    7.4.    Disclaimer of Warranties.  THE LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 7 ARE IN LIEU OF, AND
    WANDISCO HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO THOSE OF ACCURACY, MERCHANTABILITY/SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  WANDISCO DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR WORK
    PRODUCT WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE SOFTWARE, WORK PRODUCT OR ANY
    SERVICES WILL MEET CUSTOMER'S NEEDS.  FURTHER, WANDISCO MAKES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
    AND ACCEPTS NO LIABILITY FOR ANY FAILURE OR FAULT, OR ANY RESULTING HARM OR DAMAGE, RESULTING
    FROM CUSTOMER'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT OR OPERATE THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING WITHOUT
    LIMITATION FAILURE OF CUSTOMER'S HARDWARE, SOFTWARE OR NETWORK ON WHICH THE SOFTWARE
    OPERATES OR FAULTS OR FAILURES OF THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE NOR RESULTING FROM CUSTOMER'S FAILURE
    TO IMPLEMENT ADVICE PROVIDED BY WANDISCO AS PART OF ITS SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES.

8.    INDEMNIFICATION.
    8.1.    Infringement Indemnity.  WANdisco will defend any action brought against Customer by an unaffiliated third party that
    the Software, as provided by WANdisco to Customer under this Agreement and used within the scope of this Agreement,
    infringes any U.S. patent or copyright, and will pay any costs, damages and reasonable attorneys' fees attributable to such
    claim that are awarded against Customer, provided that Customer:  (a) promptly notifies WANdisco in writing of the claim;
    (b) grants WANdisco sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim; and (c) provides WANdisco with all assistance,
    information and authority required for the defense and settlement of the claim.

    8.2.    Injunctions.  If Customer's use of any of the Software hereunder is, or in WANdisco's opinion is likely to be, enjoined or
    restricted due to the type of infringement specified in Section 8.1 above, WANdisco may, at its sole option and expense:
    (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Software under the terms of this Agreement; (b) replace or modify
    such Software so that it is non-infringing and substantially equivalent in function to the enjoined or restricted Software; or (c) if
    options (a) and (b) above are not commercially feasible despite WANdisco's reasonable efforts, then WANdisco may terminate
    Customer's rights and WANdisco's obligations hereunder with respect to such Software and refund to Customer (1) for
    perpetual licenses, a pro-rata portion of the License Fee paid for such Software based on a three-year straight line
    depreciation schedule, or (2) for subscription licenses, the amount of any prepaid but unused Subscription Fees.

    8.3.    Exclusions.  Notwithstanding the terms of Section 8.1, WANdisco will have no liability for, and Customer will indemnify
    WANdisco for, any claim to the extent it results from: (a) modification of the Software made other than by WANdisco; (b) the
    combination, operation or use of any Software supplied hereunder with equipment, devices or software not supplied by
    WANdisco to the extent such a claim would have been avoided if the Software were not used in such combination; (c) failure
    of Customer to use updated or modified Software provided by WANdisco to avoid infringement; or (d) compliance by
    WANdisco with designs, plans or specifications furnished by or on behalf of Customer.

    8.4.    Sole Remedy.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 8 SET FORTH WANDISCO'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS, AND
    CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND.

9.    CONFIDENTIALITY.

    each party may disclose Confidential Information of the other party:  (a) pursuant to the order or requirement of a court,
    administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that the disclosing party gives reasonable notice to the other
    party to contest such order or requirement; and (b) on a confidential basis to legal or financial advisors.

    9.2.    Exclusions.  The use and disclosure restrictions set forth in Section 9.1 shall not apply to information that:  (a) is or

        RISE TO THE CLAIM FOR THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION OR
        CLAIM.

    10.2.    EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. NEITHER PARTY SHALL IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
    LOSSES OR DAMAGES WHICH MAY BE SUFFERED BY THE OTHER (OR ANY PERSON CLAIMING UNDER OR
    THROUGH THE SAME), WHETHER THE SAME ARE SUFFERED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OR ARE IMMEDIATE OR

    intended for use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, including without limitation the operation of
    nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons
    systems, in which the failure of the Software or work product could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
    environmental damage.  WANdisco and its suppliers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty or liability for such
    activities.

    10.5.    Basis of Bargain.  The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that WANdisco has set its prices and entered into this

    Customer.

11.    TERM AND TERMINATION.
    11.1.    Perpetual and Fixed Term Licenses.
        (a)    Term.  This Agreement will begin on the date Customer accepts this Agreement and will remain in effect thereafter
        unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  The term of each Software license granted by
        WANdisco hereunder will begin on the date of the Quotation applicable to the Software and will remain in effect thereafter until
        Customer discontinues use of such Software or until terminated earlier by either party in accordance with the terms of this
        Agreement.
        (b)    Maintenance and Support Services.  Maintenance and support services commence on the date set forth in the applicable
        Quotation and remain in effect for an initial term of one (1) year, or such other term as specified in the Quotation ("Initial
        Term"), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Following the Initial Term, maintenance and
        support services automatically renew for additional one year terms, or such other renewal terms as specified in the Quotation
        (each a "Renewal Term") unless and until Customer notifies WANdisco, no later than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the
        then-current term, that it does not wish to renew the maintenance and support services.  If Customer cancels maintenance and
        support services and thereafter reinstates such services, a reinstatement fee will apply, which, unless otherwise agreed in
        writing, is the amount of maintenance and support fees Customer would have paid had it not canceled such services.

    11.2.    Subscription Licenses.
        (a)    Term.  This Agreement will begin on the date Customer accepts this Agreement and will remain in effect thereafter
        unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Subscription licenses begin on the date set forth in
        the applicable Quotation and remain in effect for an initial term of one (1) year, or such other term as specified in the Quotation
        ("Initial Term"), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Following the Initial Term,
        subscription licenses automatically renew for additional one year terms at WANdisco's then-current annual license fee, or such
        other renewal terms as specified in the Quotation (each a "Renewal Term") unless and until either party notifies the other, no
        later than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term, that it does not wish to renew the subscription.  WANdisco
        may employ electronic means to terminate Customer's access to Software following termination of a trial version or upon
        conclusion of a subscription.
        (b)    Maintenance and Support Services.  Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Quotation, maintenance and support
        services are included in the subscription and commence and terminate on the same dates as the subscription except that
        WANdisco reserves the right to suspend and/or terminate maintenance and support services if Customer fails to implement
        advice received from WANdisco as part of the maintenance and support services.

    11.3.    Termination for Breach.  Each party will have the right to terminate this Agreement or any Software license granted
    hereunder if the other party breaches any material term of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days
    after written notice thereof.

    11.4.    Automatic Termination.  This Agreement, but not the Software licenses, will terminate automatically if Customer:
    (a) becomes the subject of any voluntary petition in bankruptcy or any voluntary proceeding relating to insolvency,
    receivership, liquidation, or composition for the benefit of creditors; or (b) becomes the subject of an involuntary petition in
    bankruptcy or any involuntary proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or composition for the benefit of
    creditors, if such petition or proceeding is not dismissed within sixty (60) days of filing.

    Customer will: (i) promptly pay all outstanding amounts owing to WANdisco, including without limitation under any statement of
    work; and (ii) immediately cease all use of the applicable Software and will promptly return to WANdisco or, at WANdisco's
    request, destroy, all WANdisco Confidential Information then in Customer's possession, including without limitation the
    applicable Software, and all copies and portions thereof, in all forms and types of media, and provide WANdisco with an
    officer's written certification, certifying to Customer's compliance with the foregoing.

    11.6.    Nonexclusive Remedy.  Termination of this Agreement by either party will be a nonexclusive remedy for breach and will
    be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of such party.

    11.7.    Survival.  The rights and obligations of the parties contained in Sections 2.7, 3.3, 5, 6, 7.4, 9, 10, 11.7 and 12 will survive
    the termination of this Agreement or of any individual Software license.

12.    GENERAL.
    12.1.    Open Source.  Certain components of the Software may contain open source software.  Information regarding open
    source included in the Software can be found at www.wandisco.com/licensing. Subject to payment of the applicable fees,
    WANdisco will perform the maintenance and support services specified in a Quotation in accordance with WANdisco's
    standard OSS support procedures as described in Appendix B, incorporated into this Agreement by reference, which
    WANdisco publishes from time to time.  "OSS" means the most recent, stable release of the open source software (i.e.,
    Subversion, Git or other open source software supported by WANdisco), which must be obtained directly from WANdisco in
    order to be supported by WANdisco.  OSS is licensed by Customer and subject to the applicable license agreement between
    Customer and the author.

    12.2.    Assignment.  Customer will have no right to assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
    otherwise, without WANdisco's prior written consent.  Any attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent will be null
    and void.

    12.3.    Governing Law and Jurisdiction.
        (a)    US and Canadian Customers.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of
        California and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof and without regard to the United Nations
        Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject
        matter hereof shall be the state and U.S. federal courts located in the jurisdiction in which WANdisco, Inc.'s headquarters is
        located.  Both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and agree that process may be served in the manner provided
        herein for giving of notices or otherwise as allowed by California state or U.S. federal law.  In any action or proceeding to
        enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees.
        (b)    Customers in All Other Jurisdictions.  If Customer acquired the Software in any other country than the US or Canada, this
        Agreement and any claim under or in connection with it shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales.  The sole
        jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be London, England.  This Agreement describes
        certain legal rights.  Customer may have other rights under the laws of Customer's state or country. Customer may also have
        rights with respect to the party from which it acquired the software. This Agreement does not change those other rights if the
        laws of Customer's state or country do not permit it to do so.

    12.4.    Government End Users.  If Customer is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government
    ("Government"), the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Software or any related
    documentation of any kind, including technical data or related manuals, is restricted in accordance with Federal Acquisition
    Regulation 12.212 for civilian agencies and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military
    agencies.  The Software is commercial computer software and the related documentation is commercial computer software
    documentation.  The use of the Software and related documentation is further restricted in accordance with the terms of this
    Agreement, or any modification hereto.

    12.5.    Export.  Customer acknowledges and agrees to comply fully with the laws and regulations of the United States that
    restrict the export and re-export of commodities and technical data of United States origin ("Export Laws") and will assure that
    neither the Software nor any direct product thereof are (1) exported or re-exported, directly or indirectly, by Customer or any of

    12.8.    Severability.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or
    unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of
    this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

    12.9.    Waiver.  The failure by either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future
    enforcement of that or any other provision.

    12.10.    Notices.  All notices required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered by courier or overnight
    delivery service, or by certified mail, and in each instance will be deemed given upon receipt.  All communications will be sent

    accordance with this Section.  Either party may change its address for notices under this Agreement by giving written notice to
    the other party by the means specified in this Section.

    12.11.    Force Majeure.  If either party is unable to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or to enjoy any of its

    communication line failure not the fault of the affected party ("Force Majeure Event"), the party who has been so affected shall
    immediately give notice to the other party and shall do everything possible to resume performance.  Upon receipt of such
    notice, all obligations under this Agreement will be immediately suspended.  If the period of nonperformance exceeds fifteen
    (15) days from the receipt of notice of the Force Majeure Event, the party whose performance has not been so affected may,
    by giving written notice, terminate this Agreement.  If a party fails to give immediate notice of any Force Majeure Event, and
    such failure to provide immediate notice causes the other party to incur costs or expenses that would have been avoided had
    such immediate notice been provided, then the party who failed to provide the requisite notice shall remain responsible for
    such costs or expenses.

    12.12.    Relationship of Parties.  The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors and this Agreement will not
    establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency between the parties.  Neither party

    WANdisco.

    12.14.    Non-Solicitation.  Customer acknowledges that WANdisco has expended substantial time and money in the selection
    and training of its employees.  Accordingly, Customer will not, directly or through an intermediary, solicit, utilize or employ any
    employees of WANdisco during or for a period of one (1) year following the termination of this Agreement.  In the event
    Customer employs an employee of WANdisco during the term of this Agreement or during the one year period after
    termination thereof, Customer shall pay, as liquidated damages to WANdisco, an amount equal to one (1) year's salary of such
    hired employee (at the payment rate at the time of the employee's termination of employment with WANdisco) plus any
    incentive bonuses paid by WANdisco to the subject employee in the twelve (12) months preceding the subject employee's
    termination of employment with WANdisco.

    12.15.    Drafting.  All parties and their counsel have had an opportunity to review and contribute to the drafting of this
    Agreement, and the rule of construction providing that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be
    employed in the interpretation of this Agreement.  This Agreement shall be construed as drafted by both parties.

    12.16.    Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, including all schedules, exhibits and attachments attached hereto, contains the
    complete understanding and agreement of the parties and, other than the terms and special terms set forth in applicable
    Quotations, supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject
    matter herein.  Except for Quotations, statements of work and change request forms, no terms, provisions or conditions of any
    purchase order, acknowledgement or other business form that either party may use in connection with the transactions
    contemplated by this Agreement will have any effect on the rights, duties or obligations of the parties under, or otherwise
    modify, this Agreement, regardless of any failure of a receiving party to object to such terms, provisions or conditions.  Any
    waiver, modification or amendment of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by duly
    authorized representatives of the parties.


Appendix A

These Maintenance and Support terms relate to and are incorporated into the Agreement.  Capitalized terms not defined in
Section 7 below have the same meaning as in the Agreement.
1.    COVERAGE
Subject to the terms hereof, WANdisco will provide maintenance and support services only to Customer and only if the
applicable fees have been paid by Customer. Customer must order the same support level for each Software copy
licensed, and failure to renew maintenance and support services for some Software copies shall result in termination of
maintenance and support services for all Software copies acquired by Customer.  Full maintenance and support services
are provided only after Customer has fully implemented the Software.  Pre-implementation support may be available from
WANdisco under a separate statement of work.

2.    MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES
    a.    Maintenance and support services consist of (a) WANdisco's online trouble ticket reporting system, (b) Telephone
    Support for critical queries, (c) Error Correction and (d) product Updates. Maintenance and support services are
    provided to, and may be accessed only by, the Technical Support Contact to whom login credentials have been
    provided.  The number of Technical Support Contacts and login credentials depends on the Software licensed by
    Customer and the support service tier selected.  Login credentials are personal to the Technical Support Contact and
    may not be shared with any other Customer personnel or contractor.  Customer is responsible for all use of such
    login credentials, and additional credentials must be obtained from WANdisco if additional Technical Support
    Contacts are desired.  Product Updates consist of one copy of published revisions to the printed documentation and
    one copy of revisions to the machine readable Software that are not New Products.

    b.    WANdisco shall advise Customer of New Products that it decides, in its sole discretion, to make available to
    Customer by adding it to the Agreement.  Payment for New Products is not covered by the maintenance and support
    or subscription fee.  All product Updates or New Products provided to Customer shall be governed by the terms of the
    Agreement, including without limitation the applicable fees and discounts. Upon installation of Updates or New
    Products, prior versions or releases are to be destroyed.

    c.    WANdisco shall provide all Resolutions to the Technical Support Contact for implementation. WANdisco
    implementation of Resolutions is provided only as a professional service, for which additional fees will apply as
    outlined in an applicable statement of work that must be executed prior to WANdisco performing such services.

    d.    WANdisco will provide maintenance and support services for OSS in accordance with this Appendix A; provided,
    however, that WANdisco makes no warranty or guarantee that any Fix, Workaround or other Error Correction
    suggested or developed by WANdisco will be accepted by the open source community and/or be incorporated into
    future OSS versions.

3.    TIERED SERVICES.  Maintenance and support services are provided to Customer in accordance with the applicable tier
purchased by Customer.  The tiers are set forth below.  Silver Support is provided only for OSS. All Software copies will
be supported under the same tier, and the parties may upgrade or downgrade the applicable tier upon mutual written
agreement.  Other information related to maintenance and support services is available at www.wandisco.com/support.

4.    ERROR PRIORITY LEVELS AND RESPONSE TIMES
    a.    WANdisco shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to correct any Error reported by Customer in the current
    unmodified release of Software in accordance with the priority level reasonably assigned to such Error by WANdisco
    and in accordance with the support level purchased by Customer.

    b.    Upon receipt of an Error report, WANdisco will promptly evaluate the reported Error and classify it as Priority 1, 2, 3,
    or 4.  As an Error is addressed, the classification of such Error may change.  Following such classification, WANdisco
    will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the following, in accordance with the support levels set forth
    below:
    i.    Respond to Customer and assign WANdisco engineers to correct the Error;
    ii.    Provide Customer with status updates of the corrections; and
    iii.    Initiate work to provide Customer with a Resolution ("Response Time").

    +----------+----------------+--------------+------------------+
    | Priority | Silver Support | Gold Support | Platinum Support |
    +----------+----------------+--------------+------------------+
    |1         | 4 hours        | 2 hours      | 1 hour           |
    |2         | 24 hours       | 16 hours     | 4 hours          |
    |3         | 72 hours       | 48 hours     | 24 hours         |
    |4         | 10 Days        | 7 Days       | 5 Days           |
    +----------+----------------+--------------+------------------+

    Response Time means the amount of time between the initial report of an Error to WANdisco and when a
    WANdisco support engineer initiates a support session with Customer's Technical Support Contact to
    resolve the Error.  Once a support session has been initiated, WANdisco will work continuously with
    Customer's Technical Support Contact, during Customer's applicable support hours as determined by
    Customer's support tier, to resolve the Error and provide a Resolution.  Errors reported via telephone by Silver
    Support Customers will be logged into the online trouble ticket system and addressed in accordance with the
    Response Times set forth above.

    c.    In order for WANdisco to perform Error Corrections, Customer must provide information and access reasonably
    requested by WANdisco, including without limitation talkbacks, Apache logs, system logs and screen shares.
    WANdisco will provide support via remote access upon Customer's request.

    d.    If WANdisco believes that a problem reported by Customer may not be due to an Error in the Software, WANdisco
    will so notify Customer. At that time, Customer may (1) instruct WANdisco to proceed with problem determination at
    Customer's possible expense as set forth below, or (2) instruct WANdisco that Customer does not wish the problem
    pursued at Customer's possible expense. If Customer requests that WANdisco proceed with problem determination
    at Customer's possible expense and WANdisco determines that the problem was not due to an Error in the Software,
    Customer shall pay WANdisco, at WANdisco' then-current and standard consulting rates, for all work performed in
    connection with such determination, plus reasonable related expenses incurred therewith. Customer shall not be
    liable for (i) problem determination or repair to the extent problems are due to Errors in the Software, (ii) work
    performed under this paragraph in excess of its instructions or (iii) work performed after Customer has notified
    WANdisco that it no longer wishes work on the problem determination to be continued at Customer's possible
    expense (such notice shall be deemed given when actually received by WANdisco). If Customer instructs WANdisco
    that it does not wish the problem pursued at Customer's possible expense or if such determination requires effort in
    excess of Customer's instructions, WANdisco may, at its sole discretion, elect not to investigate the problem with no
    liability therefor.

5.    EXCLUSIONS
        a.    WANdisco shall have no obligation to support:
        i.    altered, damaged or modified Software or any portion of the Software incorporated with or into other software;
        ii.    Software that is not the then-current release or immediately Previous Sequential Release;
        iii.    Where Customer fails to provide information or access as required in Section 4.c above.
        iv.    Software problems caused by Customer's negligence, abuse or misapplication, Customer's use of the Software
        other than as specified in the WANdisco' user manual, or by other factors beyond the control of WANdisco,
        including without limitation natural disasters, acts of God, riots, strikes, power outages or similar occurrences
        including those defined as Force Majeure Events at Section 12.9 of the Agreement; or
        v.    Software installed on any computing environment that is not supported by WANdisco.
        b.    WANdisco shall have no liability for any changes in Customer's hardware that may be necessary to use the Software
        due to a New Product, Workaround or maintenance Update.

6.    ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
    As part of the maintenance and support services provided hereunder, WANdisco may create a root cause analysis report
    to be shared with Customer.  A root cause analysis report is for information purposes only and does not obligate
    WANdisco to perform any additional services, create any additional warranties or create any additional contractual liability.

Appendix B

    These OSS support terms relate to and are incorporated into the Agreement.  Capitalized terms have the same meaning as in
    the Agreement.

    1.    OPEN SOURCE SUPPORT.

    1.1.    Support services.  If the applicable Quotation specifies that Customer is receiving OSS support (i.e., Subversion, Git
    or other OSS), WANdisco will provide support services for the term specified in the Quotation. The Services shall be
    provided through employees, contractors, vendors or Affiliates of WANdisco, as appropriate, in accordance with this
    Agreement.

    1.2.    Supported Configurations

        1.2.1.    Server Operating System.  WANdisco supports Customer's use of OSS with the server operating systems
        specified on WANdisco's support website.  If Customer is using an operating system other than one of the
        specified systems, WANdisco will provide Customer with support services only if Customer has obtained prior
        approval from WANdisco support in a written agreement signed by Customer and WANdisco.  If Customer has
        not obtained such approval and is not using one of the operating systems listed, then WANdisco will not be
        obligated to provide Customer with support services as otherwise required under this Agreement.

        1.2.2.    Client Operating System.  WANdisco supports Customer's use of OSS with client operating systems specified
        on WANdisco's support website.   If Customer is using an operating system other than one of these listed
        systems, WANdisco will provide Customer with support services only if Customer has obtained prior approval
        from WANdisco support in a written agreement signed by Customer and WANdisco.   If Customer has not
        obtained such approval and is not using one of the operating systems listed, then WANdisco will not be
        obligated to provide Customer with support services as otherwise required under this Agreement.

        1.2.3.    Client Software.  WANdisco supports Customer's use of OSS with the clients specified on WANdisco's support
        website.  If Customer is using a client other than one of these listed clients, WANdisco will provide Customer
        with support services only if Customer has obtained prior approval from WANdisco Support in a written
        agreement signed by Customer and WANdisco.  If Customer has not obtained such approval and is not using
        one of the clients listed, then WANdisco will not be obligated to provide Customer with support services as
        otherwise required under this Agreement.

        1.2.4.    Additional Required Information.  Upon Customer's purchase of OSS support services, WANdisco will send an
        email requesting certain additional information about Customer's OSS environment and the names of those
        personnel within Customer's organization who will be authorized as a "Named Support Contact" under
        Appendix A to contact WANdisco.   This information is required in order to provide complete OSS support. If
        Customer does not provide this information to WANdisco, Customer understands and agrees that this failure
        may prevent WANdisco from providing timely support and maintenance services as otherwise might be
        required under the terms of this Agreement.

    1.3.    Changes to Level of Support.  Should Customer decide to increase or decrease the level of support, Customer has
    purchased, any such change must be made by executing and submitting to WANdisco Support its standard change
    request form; provided however that if the request is to decrease the level of support, such change can only be
    made on the annual renewal anniversary for Customer's then current support level and the change request form
    must be submitted at least thirty (30) days before such anniversary.  Customer must order the same support level for
    each copy of OSS licensed.

    1.4.    License.  Upgrades and other materials are licensed to Customer under the same terms and conditions as Customer
    licensed the OSS.

    1.5.    Indemnity.  If Customer has purchased the Platinum Support Level, Customer is entitled to the following
    indemnification, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

        1.5.1.    WANdisco will defend or settle, at its expense, any action brought or allegation made against Customer by a
        third party to the extent that it is based upon a claim that the OSS provided by WANdisco to Customer under
        this Agreement and used within the scope of this Agreement, infringes any copyright, trade secret, patent or
        trademark right of such third party, and will pay any costs, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
        fees), and liabilities attributable to such claims that are awarded against Customer.  WANdisco' obligations
        hereunder are contingent on the following conditions:

        1.5.1.1.    Customer must have obtained all OSS binaries, including upgrades, from WANdisco; and

        1.5.1.2.    Customer must notify WANdisco in writing promptly after Customer becomes aware of a claim or the
        possibility thereof; and

        1.5.1.3.    Customer must grant WANdisco the sole control of the settlement, compromise, negotiation, and
        defense of any such action; and

        1.5.1.4.    Customer must provide WANdisco with all information related to the action that is reasonably requested
        by WANdisco.

    1.5.2.    The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any infringement claim to the extent arising from (i) use of binaries
    from a source other than WANdisco, (ii) OSS that has been modified by anyone other than WANdisco, (iii)
    Customer's use of OSS in conjunction with Customer's data where use with such data gave rise to the
    infringement claim, (iv) Customer's use of OSS with other software or hardware, where use with such other
    software or hardware gave rise to the infringement claim, (v) use of other than the most current, unaltered
    version of OSS if such claim would have been avoided by the use of such version, (vi) compliance by
    WANdisco with designs, plans or specifications furnished by or on behalf of Customer, or (vii) Customer's use
    or distribution of OSS not in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable license agreement.

    1.5.3.    WANdisco shall not be liable hereunder for any settlement made by Customer without WANdisco's advance
    written approval or for any award from any action in which WANdisco was not granted control of the defense.

    1.5.4.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, WANdisco's liability under this
    Appendix B shall be limited to four (4) times the amount paid or payable by Customer under this Agreement for
    OSS Support Services.

    1.5.5.    This Appendix B states WANdisco' entire liability and Customer's (and Customer's agents' and customers')
    exclusive remedy for infringement of intellectual property rights of any kind by the OSS.

    2.    OSS IS AN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, OWNED AND LICENSED BY A THIRD PARTY.  WANDISCO
    MAKES OSS AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMER SOLELY AS A CONVENIENCE AND, SAVE AS SET OUT ABOVE,
    ACCEPTS NO LIABILITY OR OBLIGATION AS A RESULT THEREOF.  WANDISCO MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
    GUARANTEES REGARDING OSS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO OSS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
    WARRANTIES OR OTHER TERMS OF MERCHANTABILITY/SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DESIGN OR USE OR ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING,
    USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE.  WANDISCO DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT OSS OR ANY
    UPDATES OR UPGRADES PROVIDED BY WANDISCO WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.

       herein.

1.9. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the
     substance or structure of either the Original Code or any

non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
claims:

2.1.a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent
       or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use,
       reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute
       the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without
       Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

2.1.b. under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling
       of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell,
       and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original
       Code (or portions thereof).

2.1.c. the licenses granted in this Section 2.1 (a) and (b) are
       effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
       Original Code under the terms of this License.

2.1.d. Notwithstanding Section 2.1 (b) above, no patent license is
       granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code;
       2) separate from the Original Code; or 3) for infringements
       caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii)
       the combination of the Original Code with other software
       or devices.

Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

2.2.a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
       trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce,
       modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the
       Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions
       thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
       Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger
       Work; and

2.2.b. under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
       of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or
       in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
       of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
       have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications
       made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the
       combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with
       its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).

2.2.c. the licenses granted in Sections 2.2 (a) and 2.2 (b) are
       effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial
       Use of the Covered Code.

2.2.c. Notwithstanding Section 2.2 (b) above, no patent license is
       granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from
       the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor
       Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party
       modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination
       of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software
       (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices;
       or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the
       absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations

3.1. Application of License

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
are governed by the terms of this License, including without
limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may
be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future
version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source
Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of
this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You
may include an additional document offering the additional rights
described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must
be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this
License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom
you made an Executable version available; and if made available
via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for
at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version
of that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications

You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered
Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including
the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b)
in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

3.4.a. Third Party Claims: If Contributor has knowledge that
       a license under a third party's intellectual property
       rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such
       Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must
       include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
       "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the
       claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
       to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
       Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
       Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
       copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
       other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
       newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received
       the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

3.4.b. Contributor APIs: If Contributor's Modifications include
       an application programming interface and Contributor has
       knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary
       to implement that API, Contributor must also include this
       information in the legal file.

3.4.c. Representations: Contributor represents that, except as
       disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor
       believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's
       original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
       to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of
the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You
created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code
where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating
to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions

You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met
for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the
terms of this License, including a description of how and where
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute
the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under
a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
of this License and that the license for the Executable version
does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If
You distribute the Executable version under a different license You
must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of
this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
must be included in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and
must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except
to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to
be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions

The H2 Group may publish revised and/or new versions of the License
from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the
terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the H2
Group. No one other than the H2 Group has the right to modify the
terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works

If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered
Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so
that the phrases "H2 Group", "H2" or any confusingly similar phrase
do not appear in your license (except to note that your license
differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that
Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
H2 License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original
Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not
of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
including, without limitation, warranties that the covered code
is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance
of the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove
defective in any respect, you (not the initial developer or any
other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes
an essential part of this license. No use of any covered code is
authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8. Termination

8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
     fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware
     of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
     are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
     License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
     effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
     Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
     Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
     "Participant") alleging that:

8.2.a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
       infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by
       such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
       License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
       prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
       notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant
       a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
       future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)
       withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor
       Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice,
       a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually
       agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
       is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You
       under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at
       the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

8.2.b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such
       Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
       infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by
       such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
       revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
       sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
       Participant.

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly
     or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved
     (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
     patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of
     the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1
     or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount
     or value of any payment or license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and
     resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
     distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
     termination.

9. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the
initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of
covered code, or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to
any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This
limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.

10. United States Government End Users

The Covered Code is a "commercial item", as that term is defined in
48 C.F.R. 2.101 (October 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
software" and "commercial computer software documentation", as such
terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (September 1995). Consistent
with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code
with only those rights set forth herein.

11. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed
by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is
a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in
United States of America, any litigation relating to this License
shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara
County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,
including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of
a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply
to this License.

12. Responsibility for Claims

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree
to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended
or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. Multiple-Licensed Code

Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
"Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
Your choice of this or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

Exhibit A

Multiple-Licensed under the H2 License, Version 1.0,
and under the Eclipse Public License, Version 1.0

   object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
   import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
   if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
   shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
   if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
   addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
   by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
   other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
   se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
   licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
   provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe
   the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
   entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
   for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement
   of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
   exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
   hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
   property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
   it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
   distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
   the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
  form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
   and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
   conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
   conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
    for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
    consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
     party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by
the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection
with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such
claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those
performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND
ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT
OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY
RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed
to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s),
then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if
it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions
of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all
Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees
to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No
one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify
this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each
new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it
was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated
in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

5. Time Zone Database

  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database section 7.

 # 7.  Database Ownership
 #
 #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
 #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
 #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
 #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
 #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
 #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
 #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
 #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
 #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
 #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
 #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
 #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
 #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

[[prologcafe_EPL]]
----
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program
by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are
not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
   license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
   publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
   Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
   object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
   import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
   if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
   shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
   if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
   addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
   by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
   other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
   se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
   licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
   provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe
   the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
   entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
   for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement
   of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
   exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
   hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
   property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
   it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
   distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
   the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
  form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
   and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
   conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
   conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
    for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
    consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
     party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by
the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection
with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such
claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those
performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND
ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT
OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY
RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed
to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s),
then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if
it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions
of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all
Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees
to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No
one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify
this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each
new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it
was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated
in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
